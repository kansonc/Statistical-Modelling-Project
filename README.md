# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
Do create a model that attempts to predict trends of bike availability at bike stations accross a city based on API data on specific business categories within a 1km radius of each bike station.

With Toronto as my city, the business categories as "restaurants", "bars", and "performance art venues", the APIs of Foursquare, citybikes, and Yelp, I created a logistical model in the attempt to find correlated data.

## Process
### step 1


### step 2

## Results
(fill in what you found about the comparative quality of API coverage in your chosen area and the results of your model.)

## Challenges 
(discuss challenges you faced in the project)

## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time?)
